# water-temp-bc

Document and serve out BC water temperature data. Scrapes the Environment Canada (ECCC) realtime web service for all BC stations and publishes parquet files to S3 (`s3://water-temp-bc/data`) for direct querying via `duckdb` + `httpfs` — no database required. Also wrangles bulk historic data forwarded by ECCC into the same parquet layout.

## Repository Context

- **Repository:** NewGraphEnvironment/water-temp-bc (public)
- **Primary language:** R (scripts + R Markdown — not an R package; no `R/` or `NAMESPACE`)
- **Published site:** http://www.newgraphenvironment.com/water-temp-bc (rendered from `README.Rmd` → `index.html`)
- **S3 bucket:** `s3://water-temp-bc/data` mirrors local `data/`

## Layout

- `README.Rmd` — source of truth; renders to `README.md` (github_document) and `index.html` (published page with DT tables of station metadata + sample queries)
- `scripts/`
  - `extract-temp-realtime.R` — initial pull of realtime data via `tidyhydat` + `ngr::ngr_hyd_realtime`, amalgamated with prior sqlite snapshot
  - `update-temp-realtime.R` — incremental scrape; writes `data/realtime_raw_<YYYYMMDD>.parquet`
  - `extract-eccc.R` — wrangles the bulk historic ECCC dump into parquet
  - `extract_stations.R` — builds `data/stations_realtime.parquet`
  - `sqlite_to_parquet.R`, `update-table-name.R` — one-time migration helpers
  - `sync-data.R` — `aws s3 sync data/ s3://water-temp-bc/data --delete`
  - `functions.R`, `utils.R`, `staticimports.R` — helpers used by `README.Rmd`
- `data/` — published parquet files (mirrored to S3); also a stray `water-temp-bc.duckdb`
- `data-raw/` — hex sticker assets

## Known state / modernization targets

- **Realtime window is ~18 months** — to maintain a long record, the scrape must run on a schedule and append to a canonical parquet rather than producing dated snapshots.
- **Multiple dated `realtime_raw_*.parquet` files in `data/`** (`20240119`, `20250728`, plus an ECCC historic `20221213`) — README flags "we will need to put them all together soon. TO DO." Consolidating these into a single canonical store is the central modernization task.
- **README.Rmd hardcodes a parquet filename** (`realtime_raw_20250521.parquet`) in its query chunks — that file isn't currently in `data/`, so queries against the published page may be stale or broken. A canonical filename (e.g. `realtime_raw.parquet`) would fix this.
- **Stations list** is currently union of `tidyhydat::realtime_stations('BC')` and an Excel of ECCC-forwarded station IDs (`data/eccc/BC_Stations_withTW.xlsx`).

# Code Check Conventions

Structured checklist for reviewing diffs before commit. Used by `/code-check`.
Add new checks here when a bug class is discovered — they compound over time.

## Shell Scripts

### Quoting
- Variables in double-quoted strings containing single quotes break if value has `'`
- `"echo '${VAR}'"` — if VAR contains `'`, shell syntax breaks
- Use `printf '%s\n' "$VAR" | command` to pipe values safely
- Heredocs: unquoted `<<EOF` expands variables locally, `<<'EOF'` does not — know which you need
- Pass-through-ssh args: `printf '%q'` escapes per-arg so workload paths with spaces / quotes / metacharacters survive the local-shell → ssh-argv → remote-shell round-trip. Without it, `ssh host 'cmd' "$path"` joins args with spaces on remote and re-parses, losing argument boundaries.

### Heredoc precedence in pipelines
- `cmd1 | cmd2 <<EOF` — the heredoc binds to `cmd2` (the rightmost simple command). If you intended `cmd1` to receive it, put `<<EOF` on cmd1 explicitly: `cmd1 <<EOF | cmd2`.
- Symptom when wrong: ssh body silently echoed by tee/cat/etc, ssh side gets empty stdin, exits 0 (or near-0) without doing anything. Caught the hard way 2026-05-01 in cypher_restore-fwapg.sh.

### pipefail with ssh+tee
- `set -eu` does NOT propagate exit codes through pipelines. `ssh ... | tee log` returns tee's exit (always 0 for healthy tee), masking ssh failure.
- Use `set -euo pipefail` for any script that pipes a meaningful command into tee/cat/grep/etc. Or check `${PIPESTATUS[0]}` explicitly.
- Symptom when wrong: task notifications report "exit 0 / completed" while remote work was actually skipped or errored.

### Paths
- Hardcoded absolute paths (`/Users/airvine/...`) break for other users
- Use `REPO_ROOT="$(cd "$(dirname "$0")/<relative>" && pwd)"`
- After moving scripts, verify `../` depth still resolves correctly
- Usage comments should match actual script location

### Silent Failures
- `|| true` hides real errors — is the failure actually safe to ignore?
- Empty variable before destructive operation (rm, destroy) — add guard: `[ -n "$VAR" ] || exit 1`
- `grep` returning empty silently — downstream commands get empty input

### Process Visibility
- Secrets passed as command-line args are visible in `ps aux`
- Use env files, stdin pipes, or temp files with `chmod 600` instead

## Cloud-Init (YAML)

### ASCII
- Must be pure ASCII — em dashes, curly quotes, arrows cause silent parse failure
- Check with: `perl -ne 'print "$.: $_" if /[^\x00-\x7F]/' file.yaml`

### YAML flow-mapping in runcmd
- Any runcmd item containing both `{` and `:` is at risk of being parsed as a YAML flow-mapping (dict), not a literal string. Cloud-init's shellify hits a non-string and throws TypeError, **aborting all subsequent runcmd steps silently** while `final_message` still fires.
- Don't write: `- test -s /file || { echo "FATAL: ..." }` — the `:` inside braces makes YAML see a dict.
- Do write: use `- |` block scalar with explicit `if/then/fi`:
  ```yaml
  - |
    if [ ! -s /file ]; then
      echo "FATAL: ..." >&2
      exit 1
    fi
  ```
- Validate post-edit: `python3 -c "import yaml; runcmd=yaml.safe_load(open('cloud-init.yaml').read().split(chr(10),1)[1])['runcmd']; print([type(x).__name__ for x in runcmd if not isinstance(x,str)] or 'all strings')"`. If the output is anything other than `all strings`, the runcmd will fail.

### State
- `cloud-init clean` causes full re-provisioning on next boot — almost never what you want before snapshot
- Use `tailscale logout` not `tailscale down` before snapshot (deregister vs disconnect)
- Wipe `/var/lib/tailscale/*` before snapshot too — `tailscale logout` deauthorizes server-side but local node identity blob persists in tailscaled.state. Snapshot restored elsewhere inherits prior key material until `tailscale up` runs again.
- Wipe `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_*` before snapshot — otherwise droplets spawned from the same image share host identity.

### Template Variables
- Secrets rendered via `templatefile()` are readable at `169.254.169.254` metadata endpoint
- Acceptable for ephemeral machines, document the tradeoff
- Heredocs in runcmd that write secrets: `<<'EOF'` (quoted) prevents bash from re-expanding `$X` sequences in already-substituted credential strings. AWS keys rarely contain `$` but base64-padded secrets might.

### Repo + key install ordering
- `apt-key adv --keyserver` is deprecated on Ubuntu 24.04 noble — silently fails AND APT ignores resulting keyring. Use `gpg --dearmor` + `signed-by=` keyring file pattern.
- Repo .list files in `write_files:` trigger the implicit `package_update` BEFORE runcmd installs the keyring → first apt-get update fails with NO_PUBKEY. Put the repo line in runcmd alongside the key install, not in write_files.

### Cloud-init users vs DO SSH key injection
- DO injects `ssh_key_ids` only into `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` (cloud-init's `cc_ssh` module). Cloud-init `users:` block with `ssh_authorized_keys: []` does NOT pick those up.
- Non-root users that need SSH access must copy from root's keys in runcmd:
  ```yaml
  - mkdir -p /home/<user>/.ssh
  - cp /root/.ssh/authorized_keys /home/<user>/.ssh/authorized_keys
  - chown -R <user>:<user> /home/<user>/.ssh
  ```
- Guard with `test -s /root/.ssh/authorized_keys` to fail loudly if `cc_ssh` hasn't run before runcmd (rare race).

## OpenTofu / Terraform

### State
- Parsing `tofu state show` text output is fragile — use `tofu output` instead
- Missing outputs that scripts need — add them to main.tf
- Snapshot/image IDs in tfvars after deleting the snapshot — stale reference

### Destructive Operations
- Validate resource IDs before destroy: `[ -n "$ID" ] || exit 1`
- `tofu destroy` without `-target` destroys everything including reserved IPs
- Snapshot ID extraction by name: use `awk -v n="$NAME" '$2 == n {print $1}'` (exact match on column 2). `grep -F "$NAME"` is substring-match and can grab a stale snapshot whose name contains the new name as a substring.

## DigitalOcean

### Snapshot disk-size constraint
- DO snapshots include the source droplet's disk size. New droplets from a snapshot must have disk **>=** snapshot disk. Resize **up** is fine; resize **down** below the snapshot disk is impossible without rebuilding.
- Build the snapshot at the smallest droplet size you'd ever want to spin from it. Sizes vs disks at writing: `g-4vcpu-16gb` = 50 GB, `g-8vcpu-32gb` / `m-4vcpu-32gb` = 100 GB, `m-8vcpu-64gb` = 200 GB.
- If your workload requires X GB RAM minimum, your snapshot floor is whatever droplet has X GB AND the smallest disk class.

### Reserved IP detach behavior
- Targeted destroy (`tofu destroy -target=module.droplet -target=...assignment...`) preserves the reserved IP at $4/mo. Full `tofu destroy` releases it (next apply gets a NEW IP).

### Reserved IP assignment race (rtj#55, rtj#85)
- DO returns 422 "Droplet already has a pending event" when reserved IP assignment fires immediately after droplet+firewall creation. The droplet's internal event queue takes time to drain.
- **Every DO droplet module that uses a reserved IP MUST have:**
  1. `time_sleep` resource between droplet creation and IP assignment, with `create_duration ≥ 60s` (10s and 30s have both been observed to race; 60s has more headroom)
  2. `depends_on = [time_sleep.<name>]` on the `digitalocean_reserved_ip_assignment` resource
  3. A retry fallback in the wrapping shell script (`up.sh` style) that detects the 422 in tofu output and uses `doctl compute reserved-ip-action assign <ip> <droplet-id>` to recover. Tofu doesn't retry; it leaves state half-applied (assignment recorded but DO didn't actually attach).
- **Snapshot-based spins are MORE prone to the race** than first-boot from blank Ubuntu (more startup events compete for the droplet's event queue).
- **Audit existing modules:** `grep -L 'time_sleep' env/do/*/<host>/main.tf` finds modules missing the gate. As of 2026-05-02, openclaw and geoserv have no `time_sleep` — they will race eventually.

## Docker / Postgres

### Postgis init time
- `imresamu/postgis` (and similar postgis images) on first cold start (empty data volume) take **5-12 min** to install all extensions — varies with disk IO and noisy-neighbor lottery on cloud hosts. Health-wait scripts must allow 15 min minimum, ideally with hard-fail + log dump on timeout.

### Tuning vs host RAM
- fresh's `docker/docker-compose.yml` defaults are tuned for a 128 GB host (`shared_buffers=32GB`, `shm_size=36gb`). On smaller hosts, postgres OOMs at startup with "could not map anonymous shared memory".
- 32 GB host floor: use the M1/cypher 32 GB-host preset (`scripts/fwapg/compose.override.m1.yml`) which sets `shared_buffers=8GB, shm_size=12gb`.
- Below 32 GB: postgres can technically start with smaller `shared_buffers` but fwapg work becomes painful. Don't run fwapg pipelines on <32 GB hosts.

### `search_path` is data, not config
- `ALTER DATABASE <db> SET search_path TO ...` is a database-level setting **stored in the postgres data dir**. Wiped with `docker compose down -v`. Must be re-applied on every restore.
- Codify in your restore script, not in cloud-init or compose env (those don't apply to db-level settings).

## Tailscale

### ACL "users" semantics
- Tailscale SSH ACL `"users": ["autogroup:nonroot"]` for `tag:compute` blocks `ssh root@<node>` over the tailnet. Use `ssh <user>@<node>` + sudo for root operations.
- For SSH-as-root from off-tailnet (regular OpenSSH on the public IP), the ACL doesn't apply — but you need the SSH key registered on the node.

### Reusable + ephemeral auth keys
- Cypher-style ephemeral compute droplets need both flags on the auth key: **Reusable** (same key works across destroy/recreate) + **Ephemeral** (tailnet entries auto-clean when offline >5 min).
- Tag the key (e.g. `tag:compute`) at creation time. Nodes joining with that key inherit the tag automatically — no `--advertise-tags` needed at `tailscale up` time.

## Security

### Secrets in Committed Files
- `.tfvars` must be gitignored (contains tokens, passwords)
- `.tfvars.example` should have all variables with empty/placeholder values
- Sensitive variables need `sensitive = true` in variables.tf

### Firewall Defaults
- `0.0.0.0/0` for SSH is world-open — document if intentional
- If access is gated by Tailscale, say so explicitly

### Credentials
- Passwords with special chars (`'`, `"`, `$`, `!`) break naive shell quoting
- `printf '%q'` escapes values for shell safety
- Temp files for secrets: create with `chmod 600`, delete after use

## R / Package Installation

### pak Behavior
- pak stops on first unresolvable package — all subsequent packages are skipped
- Removed CRAN packages (like `leaflet.extras`) must move to GitHub source
- PPPM binaries may lag a few hours behind new CRAN releases

### Reproducibility
- Branch pins (`pkg@branch`) are not reproducible — document why used
- Pinned download URLs (RStudio .deb) go stale — document where to update

### Base name shadowing in formal args
- Avoid `names`, `length`, `data`, `c`, `t`, `T`, `F`, etc. as formal argument names. R's function-lookup fallback often rescues `names(x)` calls inside a function whose arg is also called `names` — but it's a confusing read, breaks under refactors, and generates a real "could not find function" error when the lookup heuristic misses (e.g. inside lapply/vapply/match.fun chains). Prefer descriptive alternatives: `label_names`, `n`, `df`, etc.
- Caught in mc#33 round 1 — `mc_label_ensure(names)` worked by luck when calling `names(existing)` to read a named-vector's names; renamed to `label_names` for safety.

### Cross-function consistency for label/string normalization
- When two functions in the same package both decide whether a string is a "system value" (or any normalized form), they MUST use the same comparison. Mismatches are silent bugs that surface only on edge cases.
- mc#33 example: `mc_label_ensure` used `toupper(nm) %in% sys` (case-insensitive system-label skip), but `resolve_label_names` used `nm %in% sys` (case-sensitive). Result: `add = "inbox"` with `create_missing = TRUE` was silently broken — ensure skipped creation, resolve couldn't match. Fix: both use `toupper(nm) %in% sys` and the resolver normalizes its return to the canonical case.
- Generalized check: when reviewing a diff that adds normalization (case, whitespace, prefix-trim) on one side of an interaction, grep for the other side and align them.

## General

### Adopting Existing Config

When importing config from one location into a canonical one (legacy `~/.bash_profile` → dotfiles repo, old script's env → repo, another project's `settings.json` → soul):

- **Verify every referenced path/binary exists.** Dead PATH exports, missing interpreters, stale env vars should be cut, not codified.
  Shell paths: `for p in $(echo "$PATH" | tr ':' ' '); do [ -d "$p" ] || echo "DEAD: $p"; done`
- **Ask before dropping a reference** — it may be something the user forgot to reinstall on this machine, not something to delete.
- **Curated subset, not verbatim copy.** The diff should reflect what you verified, not the whole source.

### Documentation Staleness
- Moving/renaming scripts: update CLAUDE.md, READMEs, usage comments
- New variables: update .tfvars.example
- New workflows: update relevant README


# NGE Feature Workflow

For non-trivial issue-driven work, follow this checklist. Each step exists for a reason — skipping leads to rework, broken builds, and avoidable bugs that we've hit repeatedly.

## The Sequence

1. **Start with `/planning-init <N>`** — given an issue number, enters plan mode for codebase exploration, presents a phase breakdown for user approval, then scaffolds branch + PWF baseline with the approved phases. One command replaces the manual issue → explore → plan → branch → scaffold dance.
2. **Write robust tests first** — failing tests that reproduce the issue or document the new behavior. Tests are the contract; they fail until the work makes them pass.
3. **Name with intent** — functions, parameters, internal helpers carry the naming style of the package they live in. Look at existing exports as the guide; consistency over cleverness. (Per-package naming convention TBD — see soul issue tracking.)
4. **Examples that run** — every exported function gets a runnable `@examples` block. Pkgdown renders them; CI executes them. An example that doesn't run is documentation rot.
5. **Code-check before each commit** — `/code-check` on staged diff. Catches what tests miss: edge cases, hard-coded paths, unguarded variables, security issues.
6. **Atomic commits** — each commit bundles code change + checkbox flip in `task_plan.md`. The diff and the progress live in the same commit; `git log -- planning/` tells the full story.
7. **`/planning-archive` when complete** — moves PWF to `archive/YYYY-MM-issue-N-slug/`, creates a fresh `active/`. Then `/gh-pr-push` opens the PR; `/gh-pr-merge` handles the release bookkeeping.

## When to Skip

For one-line typo fixes, version-bump-only PRs, or trivial documentation edits, the full workflow is overhead. Use judgment. The threshold is roughly: **multi-step issue, multi-file change, or anything that requires scoping** → use the workflow.

## Skills That Slot In

- `/planning-init <N>` — start
- `/planning-update` — sync checkboxes mid-session
- `/code-check` — before every commit
- `/planning-archive` — when issue closes
- `/gh-pr-push` — open the PR
- `/gh-pr-merge` — merge with release bookkeeping

## Why This Exists

We've hit snags repeatedly when half-doing this — branches that mix concerns, tests bolted on after, code-check skipped (and then a bug ships in the diff), examples that fail in pkgdown. Each step is small; the cumulative reliability gain is real. The convention is here so it becomes the default expectation, not a thing the user has to remind every session about.


# LLM Behavioral Guidelines

<!-- Source: https://github.com/forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills/main/CLAUDE.md -->
<!-- Last synced: 2026-02-06 -->
<!-- These principles are hardcoded locally. We do not curl at deploy time. -->
<!-- Periodically check the source for meaningful updates. -->

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.


**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.


# Planning Conventions

How Claude manages structured planning for complex tasks using planning-with-files (PWF).

## When to Plan

Use PWF when a task has multiple phases, requires research, or involves more than ~5 tool calls. Triggers:
- User says "let's plan this", "plan mode", "use planning", or invokes `/planning-init`
- Complex issue work begins (multi-step, uncertain approach)
- Claude judges the task warrants structured tracking

Skip planning for single-file edits, quick fixes, or tasks with obvious next steps.

## The Workflow

1. **Explore first** — Enter plan mode (read-only). Read code, trace paths, understand the problem before proposing anything.
2. **Plan to files** — Write the plan into 3 files in `planning/active/`:
   - `task_plan.md` — Phases with checkbox tasks
   - `findings.md` — Research, discoveries, technical analysis
   - `progress.md` — Session log with timestamps and commit refs
3. **Plan-review with the Plan agent before committing the plan** — After scaffolding `task_plan.md` but BEFORE the baseline commit, spawn the Plan subagent (`Agent({subagent_type: "Plan", prompt: "..."}`) and ask it to critically review the task_plan against the issue body + actual codebase. Categorize findings as Blocker / Gap / Ordering / Assumption / Scope / Acceptance. Address each before committing. The agent reads files fresh — it catches what you miss when you've been thinking about the design too long. Real example: caught 21 issues including hardcoded literals across 4 files not listed in the plan, untested DB column mismatches, unfixable test-literal-string assertions, and a baseline-cache-shadow that would have produced a 6-second no-op run. Cost: ~5 min agent. Saves: hours of mid-implementation rework.
4. **Commit the plan** — After Plan-agent review + fixes. This is the baseline.
5. **Work in atomic commits** — Each commit bundles code changes WITH checkbox updates in the planning files. The diff shows both what was done and the checkbox marking it done.
6. **Code check before commit** — Run `/code-check` on staged diffs before committing. Don't mark a task done until the diff passes review.
7. **Archive when complete** — Move `planning/active/` to `planning/archive/` via `/planning-archive`. Write a README.md in the archive directory with a one-paragraph outcome summary and closing commit/PR ref — future sessions scan these to catch up fast.

## Atomic Commits (Critical)

Every commit that completes a planned task MUST include:
- The code/script changes
- The checkbox update in `task_plan.md` (`- [ ]` -> `- [x]`)
- A progress entry in `progress.md` if meaningful

This creates a git audit trail where `git log -- planning/` tells the full story. Each commit is self-documenting — you can backtrack with git and understand everything that happened.

## File Formats

### task_plan.md

Phases with checkboxes. This is the core tracking file.

```markdown
# Task Plan

## Phase 1: [Name]
- [ ] Task description
- [ ] Another task

## Phase 2: [Name]
- [ ] Task description
```

Mark tasks done as they're completed: `- [x] Task description`

### findings.md

Append-only research log. Discoveries, technical analysis, things learned.

```markdown
# Findings

## [Topic]
[What was found, with source/date]
```

### progress.md

Session entries with commit references.

```markdown
# Progress

## Session YYYY-MM-DD
- Completed: [items]
- Commits: [refs]
- Next: [items]
```

## Directory Structure

```
planning/
  active/          <- Current work (3 PWF files)
  archive/         <- Completed issues
    YYYY-MM-issue-N-slug/
```

If `planning/` doesn't exist in the repo, run `/planning-init` first.

## Skills

| Skill | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| `/planning-init` | First time in a repo — creates directory structure |
| `/planning-update` | Mid-session — sync checkboxes and progress |
| `/planning-archive` | Issue complete — archive and create fresh active/ |


# Reference Management Conventions

How references flow between Claude Code, Zotero, and technical writing at New Graph Environment.

## Tool Routing

Three tools, different purposes. Use the right one.

| Need | Tool | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| Search by keyword, read metadata/fulltext, semantic search | **MCP `zotero_*` tools** | pyzotero, works with Zotero item keys |
| Look up by citation key (e.g., `irvine2020ParsnipRiver`) | **`/zotero-lookup` skill** | Citation keys are a BBT feature — pyzotero can't resolve them |
| Create items, attach PDFs, deduplicate | **`/zotero-api` skill** | Connector API for writes, JS console for attachments |

**Citation keys vs item keys:** Citation keys (like `irvine2020ParsnipRiver`) come from Better BibTeX. Item keys (like `K7WALMSY`) are native Zotero. The MCP works with item keys. `/zotero-lookup` bridges citation keys to item data.

**BBT citation key storage:** As of Feb 2025+, BBT stores citation keys as a `citationKey` field directly in `zotero.sqlite` (via Zotero's item data system), not in a separate BBT database. The old `better-bibtex.sqlite` and `better-bibtex.migrated` files are stale and no longer updated. Query citation keys with: `SELECT idv.value FROM items i JOIN itemData id ON i.itemID = id.itemID JOIN itemDataValues idv ON id.valueID = idv.valueID JOIN fields f ON id.fieldID = f.fieldID WHERE f.fieldName = 'citationKey'`.

## Adding References Workflow

### 1. Search and flag

When research turns up a reference:
- **DOI available:** Tell the user — Zotero's magic wand (DOI lookup) is the fastest path
- **ResearchGate link:** Flag to user for manual check — programmatic fetch is blocked (403), but full text is often there
- **BC gov report:** Search [ACAT](https://a100.gov.bc.ca/pub/acat/), for.gov.bc.ca library, EIRS viewer
- **Paywalled:** Note it, move on. Don't waste time trying to bypass.

### 2. Add to Zotero

**Preferred order:**
1. DOI magic wand in Zotero UI (fastest, most complete metadata)
2. Web API POST with `collections` array (grey literature, local PDFs — targets collection directly, no UI interaction needed)
3. `saveItems` via `/zotero-api` (batch creation from structured data — requires UI collection selection)
4. JS console script for group library (when connector can't target the right collection)

**Collection targeting:** `saveItems` drops items into whatever collection is selected in Zotero's UI. Always confirm with the user before calling it. **Web API bypasses this** — include `"collections": ["KEY"]` in the POST body. Find collection keys with `?q=name` search on the collections endpoint.

### 3. Attach PDFs

`saveItems` attachments silently fail. Don't use them. Instead:

1. **Web API S3 upload (preferred):** Create attachment item → get upload auth → build S3 body (Python: prefix + file bytes + suffix) → POST to S3 → register with uploadKey. Works without Zotero running. See `/zotero-api` skill section 4.
2. **JS console fallback:** Download with `curl`, attach via `item_attach_pdf.js` in Zotero JS console.
3. Verify attachment exists via MCP: `zotero_get_item_children`

### 4. Verify

After manual adds, confirm via MCP:
- `zotero_search_items` — find by title
- `zotero_get_item_metadata` — check fields are complete
- `zotero_get_item_children` — confirm PDF attached

### 5. Clean up

If duplicates were created (common with `saveItems` retries):
- Run `collection_dedup.js` via Zotero JS console
- It keeps the copy with the most attachments, trashes the rest

## In Reports (bookdown)

### Bibliography generation

```yaml
# index.Rmd — dynamic bib from Zotero via Better BibTeX
bibliography: "`r rbbt::bbt_write_bib('references.bib', overwrite = TRUE)`"
```

`rbbt` pulls from BBT, which syncs with Zotero. Edit references in Zotero → rebuild report → bibliography updates.

**Library targeting:** rbbt must know which Zotero library to search. This is set globally in `~/.Rprofile`:

```r
# default library — NewGraphEnvironment group (libraryID 9, group 4733734)
options(rbbt.default.library_id = 9)
```

Without this option, rbbt searches only the personal library (libraryID 1) and won't find group library references. The library IDs map to Zotero's internal numbering — use `/zotero-lookup` with `SELECT DISTINCT libraryID FROM citationkey` against the BBT database to discover available libraries.

### Citation syntax

- `[@key2020]` — parenthetical: (Author 2020)
- `@key2020` — narrative: Author (2020)
- `[@key1; @key2]` — multiple
- `nocite:` in YAML — include uncited references

### Cite primary sources

When a review paper references an older study, trace back to the original and cite it. Don't attribute findings to the review when the original exists. (See LLM Agent Conventions in `newgraph.md`.)

**When the original is unavailable** (paywalled, out of print, can't locate): use secondary citation format in the prose and include bib entries for both sources:

> Smith et al. (2003; as cited in Doctor 2022) found that...

Both `@smith2003` and `@doctor2022` go in the `.bib` file. The reader can then track down the original themselves. Flag incomplete metadata on the primary entry — it's better to have a partial reference than none at all.

## PDF Fallback Chain

When you need a PDF and the obvious URL doesn't work:

1. DOI resolver → publisher site (often has OA link)
2. Europe PMC (`europepmc.org/backend/ptpmcrender.fcgi?accid=PMC{ID}&blobtype=pdf`) — ncbi blocks curl
3. SciELO — needs `User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0` header
4. ResearchGate — flag to user for manual download
5. Semantic Scholar — sometimes has OA links
6. Ask user for institutional access

Always verify downloads: `file paper.pdf` should say "PDF document", not HTML.

## Searching Paper Content (ragnar)

### Setup (per project)
- `scripts/rag_build.R` — maps citation keys to Zotero PDF attachment keys, builds DuckDB
- `data/rag/` gitignored — store is local, not committed
- Dependencies: ragnar, Ollama with nomic-embed-text model
- See `/lit-search` skill for full recipe

### Query
`ragnar_store_connect()` then `ragnar_retrieve()` — returns chunks with source file attribution.

### Anti-patterns
- NEVER write abstracts manually — if CrossRef has no abstract, leave blank
- NEVER cite specific numbers without verifying from the source PDF via ragnar search
- NEVER paraphrase equations — copy exact notation and cite page/section
